# JSON Columns

Navigate JSON-encoded data in a simple column-based interface, either to gain a general sense of the data structure or to create a copy-pastable path to a given value. 

## Usage

For now, the best way to use this tool is by visiting [json-navigator.com](http://json-navigator.com).

## Why is this on NPM?
I'm working on a command line tool to generate a JSON Columns page that's pre-loaded with data from a user-supplied file, and am using this package as a module in that project.
