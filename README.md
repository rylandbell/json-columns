# JSON Navigator

JSON-encoded objects can be challenging to navigate, whether you are working with your own code or data you've found elsewhere. To help, I made a simple tool that offers a visual way to navigate JSON data. My hope is that this tool can help with gaining a general sense of the object's data structure, or with finding the path needed to reference a specific value.

## Usage

Find a JSON string, and copy it to your clipboard. This app allows you to explore the data structure of the encoded object, and provides a copy-able Javascript path to reference any value in the object.
